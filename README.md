# US FX Dynamic Rates Project


<H3> Static Rates System </H3>
<p> Previously, rates provided to the FX customers were static; the same for the entire day. 
All clients received the same rate for each currency pair regardless of their relationship with the bank or the volume of the transaction. This was true for all commercial and retail channels. </p>


<H3> New Dynamic Rates System  </H3>
<p> With the Dynamic Rates Engine, BBVA USA channels can be integrated to <strong>live market rates </strong>, and prices can be segmented according to multiple customer variables. </p>

<p> At a high level, this diagram shows the systems integrations needed to allow channels to receive real time rates, which will not only mean a process automatization for the current workflow, but also an enhancement to the service we provide to our customers. </p>
